   * Constructs a 64-bit two's-complement integer, given its low and high 32-bit
   * values as *signed* integers.  See the from* functions below for more
   * convenient ways of constructing Longs.
   *
   * The internal representation of a long is the two given signed, 32-bit values.
   * We use 32-bit pieces because these are the size of integers on which
   * Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and
   * multiplication, we split each number into 16-bit pieces, which can easily be
   * multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow
   * or change in sign.
   *
   * In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the
   * positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.
   * Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE
   * (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as
   * a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this
   * case would often result in infinite recursion.
